You can protect these logins with a master password. \n\n\nLockbox is a stand-alone password manager extension that you can secure with a Firefox Account for newer encryption than what is offered with password manager. \n\n\nThe alpha version of Lockbox lets you create, store and manage entries (a site\u2019s username and password) and copy and paste login information. We realize managing passwords this way may feel very manual, but we plan to add features like autofill and password generation in future releases. We are also working to build cloud backup, create a mobile app, and support multiple browsers.\n\n\nCan I use Lockbox and the Firefox password manager at the same time?\n\n\nNo. When you install Lockbox, Firefox automatically disables the password manager. If you disable or delete Lockbox, Firefox re-enables password manager on the browser\u2019s next restart.\n\n\nIf I disable or delete Lockbox, will login information from my entries transfer into the password manager?\n\n\nNo. But login information you previously added to password manager will still be available.\n\n\nDoes Lockbox import my information from password manager?\n\n\nNot in the current alpha version.\n\n\nWhat security technology does Lockbox use?\n\n\nWhen you protect Lockbox with a Firefox Account, Lockbox uses \nAES256-GCM\n encryption, a tamper-resistent block cipher technology, to protect your data. Lockbox also uses \nHMAC SHA-256\n to \u201chash\u201d searchable data for additional security. \n\n\nHow do I disable or delete Lockbox?\n\n\n\n\nClick the menu button \n\n and choose Add-ons \n\n\n or \n Lockbox\n\n\n\n\nIf I delete Lockbox, what happens to the entries I\u2019ve saved?\n\n\nThe alpha version of Lockbox doesn\u2019t offer backup or synchronization. You\u2019ll need to re-add login information to Lockbox after installing it again.\n\n\nWhat if I forget my Firefox Account password?\n\n\nFirefox Accounts do not offer password recovery functionality. If you added a Firefox Account to Lockbox and forget your password, you\u2019ll need to reset your Firefox Account. Note that you\u2019ll lose all saved Lockbox entries.\n\n\nWill Lockbox work with other password managers?\n\n\nThe alpha version of Lockbox hasn\u2019t been tested widely with other password managers. We recommend disabling or deleting other password managers from Firefox before installing Lockbox.\n\n\nDo Lockbox entries sync to other computers with Lockbox installed?\n\n\nNo, not currently.\n\n\nCan I try Lockbox if I don\u2019t have a Mozilla.com email address?\n\n\nSure. To get started, click the \nInstall Lockbox\n button on the Introduction page. Note that this is an alpha version. Features and functionality will change as we continue developing Lockbox.\n\n\nIf I already have a Firefox Account, can I create a separate Firefox Account to use only with Lockbox?\n\n\nYou can create a new account using a different email address than the one you use for your existing Firefox Account.

It documents all events currently collected through telemetry, as well those planned for collection but not currently implemented. It will be updated periodically to reflect all new and planned data collection.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nData collection is done solely for the purpose of product development, improvement and maintenance. Specifically, it is done to help its creators examine the validity of the following hypothesis.\n\n\nCore Hypothesis: \nWe believe that people want the browser to do more than only remember their passwords.\n\n\nWe will know this to be true when:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe password generator is clicked 20% of the time a new entry is created. \nThis will indicate that users value the ability to create secure passwords.\n (Events regarding password generation will be added when feature development is complete)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75% of Lockbox downloads result in a Firefox account attached. \nThis will indicate that users value secure storage for their credentials.\n We currently record the event \nfxaUpgrade\n to know whether a user has attached an Firefox account to their lockbox installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60% of users choose to import their existing credentials from Firefox into Lockbox. \nThis will indicate that users trust lockbox more than the browser for managing their credentials.\n (Events regarding the importing of credentials from the firefox password manager will be added when feature development is complete)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe increased engagement with the management system (Create-Read-Update-Delete; CRUD) for users that import their credentials. \nThis will indicate that users value greater visibility into the number of accounts that they have.\n We currently record \nrender\n events when a user opens the credential manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRUD usage rates are comparable to Firefox login manager usage prior to lockbox installation. \nThis will indicate that users value Lockbox's credential management system, and use it to access credentials when they are needed.\n Firefox telemetry currently collects data on password autofill usage, which requires credentials be stored in the firefox password manager. We plan to compare lockbox credential usage (e.g. via the \nusernameCopied\n and \npasswordCopied\n lockbox events) to pre-lockbox autofill frequencies on a per-user basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20% of Lockbox users access their datastore on more than 1 device, \nindicating that users value having a single datastore of credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther questions we aim to answer through data collection, but are not directly related to the hypothesis above:\n\n\n\n\nDo people Save Passwords in Lockbox?\n\n\nHow many? (measured by count of items saved per user)\n\n\nHow often? (number of credentials saved per user per time interval)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people create their own passwords or use Lockbox to generate them?\n\n\nRatio: (Number of times the PW generator is used when storing an item) / (number of credentials stored)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the pw generator, do people create purely random passwords or customize them with their own input? (if this is going to be in the final design)\n\n\nDo people use the passwords they store on Lockbox?\n\n\nHow many times (per some unit of time) do stored credentials get filled?\n\n\nHow many times (per some unit of time) do stored credentials get copied?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many times do users click to reveal a password?\n\n\nDo people continue to use Lockbox after first use?\n\n\nOut of those who install, how many use it more than once?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere are the drop-off points in the user flow?\n\n\nDo the majority of people make it all the way through the setup process?\n\n\nOnce initially setup, do people continue to add credentials?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people sync their passwords between Firefox instances?\n\n\nHow does syncing affect engagement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollection\n\n\nAt this point, all measurements related to Lockbox will be made client-side. However, future releases will give users the option to sync their Lockbox data via an FxA account, at which point additional measurements will be logged server-side through the FxA data pipeline. We are not directly responsible for the measurements made through that mechanism.\n\n\nFor our internal alpha release, we will be making use of the public JavaScript API that allows recording and sending of event data and scalar data through an add-on. The API is documented here:\n\n\nhttps://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/collection/events.html#the-api\n\n\nOnce events are logged in the client they should appear in \nabout:telemetry\n. From there they will be submitted in the main ping payload under \nprocesses.dynamic.events\n and available through the usual services (STMO and ATMO), as well as amplitude.\n\n\nEvent Registration and Recording\n\n\nThe events that we will record will conform to the structure expected by the telemetry pipeline. When the events are logged in telemetry they will be a list of:\n\n\n[timestamp, category, method, object, value, extra]\n\n\nThe API takes care of the timestamp for us. We just need to define \ncategory\n, \nmethod\n, \nobject\n and \nextra\n (\nvalue\n is optional and we won't use it).\n\n\nBecause we are using the API through an add-on it \nisn't\n necessary that we include an events.yaml file.\n\n\nInstead we will define our events by \nregistering\n them using a call to \nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(category, eventData)\n.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of how a to register a typical event:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nevent_category\n, {\n    \nevent_name\n: {\n        methods: [\nclick\n, ... ], // types of events that can occur\n        objects: [\na_button\n, ... ], // objects event can occur on\n        extra: {\nkey\n: \nvalue\n, ... } // key-value pairs (strings)\n    }\n\n\n\n\nFor our purposes, we will use the \nextra\n field for a few purposes:\n\n\n\n\nTo log the UUID of the item that has been added or changed (e.g. \n\"item_id\": UUID\n)\n\n\nTo log the fields that are modified when an item is updated in the datastore (e.g. \n\"fields\": \"password,notes\"\n  (because the value has to be a string we will have to concat the fields that were updated somehow)\n\n\n\n\nOnce an event is registered, we can record it with:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(category, method, object, null, extra)\n\n\nWhen recording, we can use \nnull\n for \nvalue\n.\n\n\nSee the Events section for specific examples of event registration and recording.\n\n\nScalar recording\n\n\nWe use the js api for scalar recording as well. Here registration happens with the following syntax:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerScalars(category, {\n    \nscalar_name\n: {\n        kind: services.Telemetry.SCALAR_TYPE_COUNT, // SCALAR_TYPE_COUNT, SCALAR_TYPE_BOOLEAN. or SCALAR_TYPE_STRING\n        keyed: false,\n        record_on_release: false, // NEEDS TO BE SET TO RECORD ON RELEASE CHANNEL\n        expired: false,\n    }\n\n\n\n\nWe set scalar values in the following way:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.scalarSet(\n    \ncategory.scalar_name\n, value\n);\n\n\n\n\ne.g. \nlockboxV1.datastoreCount\n for the scalar name.\n\n\nWe can also use \nscalarAdd\n to increment a scalar value by some amount.\n\n\nScalar Metrics\n\n\nThese are the metrics we currently collect regarding the state of user datastores.\n\n\n\n\ndatastoreCount\n (integer). Current count of the number of items in the user's datastore. Note that this scalar is only updated when the user renders their full item list, either in the management view or in the doorhanger. So when testing whether this scalar is accurately updated, please re-render the item list.\n\n\n\n\nList of Events Currently Recorded\n\n\nAll events are currently implemented under the \ncategory: lockboxV2\n. The \nextra\n field contains \nitemid\n for events pertaining to a particular Lockbox item. They are listed and grouped together below based on the contents of the event's \nmethod\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstartup\n fires when the webextension is loaded. \nobjects\n: webextension.

As a Firefox Account user, I can set it up in 5 clicks or less, and retrieve and fill my credentials in 3 clicks or less.  As a security conscious user, I understand the value of the password manager, what it is going to do for me without making me feel overwhelmed. I'm notified of the password manager when I'm ready to make the most use of it, and I can set up and access my accounts as easily as writing them down in a document or notebook.  When I log into websites and applications, I want to ensure my identity is protected, so only I can securely access my accounts with my identity.  When I create a new account online I want to save the newly created credentials so I can quickly log in the next time I need access to that account.  When I go to sign into an account, I want my account credentials to populate the form fields when available, and be accessible in one location when not.  When I need to change my account credentials, I want to be able to access my credentials and update them with recovery options to restore previous account credentials.  When I want to access my account on my mobile device, I want my account credentials accessible from when I saved them in the browser last, and vice versa, ideally without having to navigate to one location to then manually type in the credentials as viewable on screen.",
